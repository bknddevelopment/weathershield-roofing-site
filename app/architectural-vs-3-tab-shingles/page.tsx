      description="Choosing between architectural (dimensional) and 3-tab asphalt shingles is one of the most common roofing decisions homeowners face. While both are asphalt-based shingles, they differ significantly in construction, appearance, performance, and lifespan. Architectural shingles feature multi-layered construction creating dimensional texture, while 3-tab shingles are single-layer with a flat, uniform appearance. Understanding these differences helps you make the right investment for your home, budget, and long-term needs."

          title: "Construction Differences",
          description: "3-tab shingles are single-layer asphalt strips with three tabs creating a uniform, repetitive pattern. They're thinner (typically 1/8\" thick) and lighter weight. Architectural shingles use multi-layered construction with random tab cutouts and varied thickness (5/16\" to 1/2\"), creating a three-dimensional, textured appearance. This layered construction also provides superior durability and weather resistance."

          title: "Aesthetic Appearance",
          description: "3-tab shingles have a flat, uniform appearance with visible horizontal lines from the tab cutouts. While clean and simple, they lack visual depth. Architectural shingles feature random, varied patterns creating shadow lines and texture that mimics premium materials like wood shake or slate. From the curb, architectural shingles significantly enhance home aesthetics and perceived value. Most new construction has shifted entirely to architectural shingles."

          title: "Lifespan & Durability",
          description: "3-tab shingles typically last 15-20 years in coastal climates like Myrtle Beach. Architectural shingles last 25-30 years or more—roughly 50% longer. The additional layers and thickness make architectural shingles more resistant to wind damage, UV degradation, and thermal cycling. Over the life of a home, you'll replace 3-tab roofs more frequently, often making architectural shingles the better long-term investment despite higher upfront cost."

          title: "Wind Resistance Performance",
          description: "This is perhaps the most critical difference for coastal Myrtle Beach homes. 3-tab shingles typically carry ASTM D3161 Class A wind ratings (60-70 mph)—inadequate for hurricane-prone areas. Architectural shingles achieve ASTM D7158 Class H ratings (110-130 mph), providing far superior hurricane protection. Many building codes in coastal areas now require Class H ratings. For Myrtle Beach homeowners, architectural shingles' wind resistance alone justifies the extra cost."

        {
          title: "Warranty Coverage",
          description: "3-tab shingles typically come with 20-25 year limited warranties covering material defects. Architectural shingles offer 30-50 year warranties, with many carrying 'lifetime' limited warranties (50 years or life of original homeowner). Enhanced warranties often include coverage for wind damage, algae resistance, and transferable benefits for resale. The stronger warranties reflect manufacturers' confidence in architectural shingles' superior longevity."

          title: "Cost Comparison & ROI",
          description: "3-tab shingles are the most economical option upfront. However, when factoring in lifespan, warranties, energy efficiency, and resale value, architectural shingles often provide better ROI. Architectural shingles cost 30-40% more in materials but last 50% longer. Over 30 years, you'll replace a 3-tab roof at least once (doubling costs) while architectural shingles remain intact. For long-term homeownership, architectural shingles deliver superior value."

          question: "Are architectural shingles worth the extra cost over 3-tab?",
          answer: "For most homeowners, yes—especially in coastal hurricane-prone areas like Myrtle Beach. Architectural shingles cost 30-40% more upfront but last 50% longer (25-30 years vs. 15-20 years), offer far superior wind resistance (110-130 mph vs. 60-70 mph), and carry stronger warranties. Over 30 years, you'll replace a 3-tab roof at least once, doubling costs, while architectural shingles remain intact. They also increase home value and curb appeal. Unless extreme budget constraints exist, architectural shingles are the better long-term investment."
        },
        {
          question: "Why are 3-tab shingles becoming less common?",
          answer: "Many major manufacturers have phased out or discontinued 3-tab shingles due to declining demand and poor performance compared to architectural shingles. Building codes in hurricane-prone areas now require higher wind ratings that 3-tab shingles can't meet. Homeowners and builders have shifted to architectural shingles for superior performance, aesthetics, and value. While 3-tab shingles are still available from some manufacturers, their market share has dropped from 80% in the 1990s to less than 10% today."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I install architectural shingles over my existing 3-tab roof?",
          answer: "While building codes allow up to two layers of shingles, we strongly recommend complete tear-off for several reasons: 1) You can't inspect the roof deck for hidden damage, 2) Multiple layers trap heat, shortening new shingle lifespan, 3) The uneven surface of layered shingles compromises the new roof's appearance and performance, 4) Warranty coverage is often reduced or voided. Tear-off ensures proper installation and maximizes your new roof's lifespan—especially important when investing in premium architectural shingles."
        },
        {
          question: "Do architectural shingles require more maintenance than 3-tab?",
          answer: "No—both require the same minimal maintenance (annual inspections, gutter cleaning, debris removal). If anything, architectural shingles require less long-term attention because they're more durable and less prone to wind damage. Both should be installed with algae-resistant coatings in humid coastal climates. The key difference is frequency of replacement: you'll replace 3-tab roofs more often, while architectural shingles provide longer maintenance-free service."
        },
        {
          question: "Will architectural shingles make my house look better for resale?",
          answer: "Absolutely. Architectural shingles significantly enhance curb appeal and perceived home value. Real estate professionals report that homes with architectural shingles sell faster and command higher prices than comparable homes with 3-tab or aging shingles. Buyers view architectural shingles as premium roofing that won't require replacement soon. The dimensional texture and shadow lines create visual interest that flat 3-tab shingles can't match. For resale value, architectural shingles are one of the best ROI home improvements."
        },
        {
          question: "Are there situations where 3-tab shingles make sense?",
          answer: "Yes, in limited scenarios: 1) Rental properties or temporary structures where maximum budget economy is required, 2) Homes being sold imminently where minimal investment is desired, 3) Sheds, garages, or outbuildings where premium roofing isn't necessary. However, even for these applications, we generally recommend architectural shingles due to better wind resistance and longer lifespan. In hurricane-prone Myrtle Beach, the wind resistance difference alone makes architectural shingles the safer, smarter choice."

      climateNote="For Myrtle Beach's coastal hurricane environment, the wind resistance difference between 3-tab (60-70 mph) and architectural (110-130 mph) shingles is critical. Hurricane-force winds routinely exceed 3-tab ratings, leading to catastrophic roof failures. Architectural shingles are the minimum recommended option for coastal South Carolina. Combined with humid, salt-air conditions that accelerate weathering, architectural shingles' superior durability makes them the clear choice for Myrtle Beach homeowners."
