const faqs = [
  {
    question: 'Which is better: hip or gable roof?',
    answer: 'Neither is universally "better"—the right choice depends on your climate, budget, architectural style, and priorities. Hip roofs excel in wind resistance and durability, making them ideal for hurricane zones and high-wind areas. Gable roofs offer more attic space, better ventilation, and lower cost, making them popular in moderate climates. Consider your specific needs and consult with a roofing professional.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Why are hip roofs more expensive than gable roofs?',
    answer: 'Hip roofs cost 15-20% more due to increased complexity and material requirements. They have four sloped sides instead of two, requiring more lumber, shingles, underlayment, and labor. The additional ridge lines, hips, and valleys create more cutting and fitting work. However, this investment often pays off in superior wind resistance and longer lifespan, especially in harsh climates.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Which roof style lasts longer?',
    answer: 'Hip roofs typically last 5-10 years longer than gable roofs due to their self-bracing design and superior wind resistance. The inward slope of all four sides makes hip roofs more stable in extreme weather. With proper maintenance, hip roofs can last 30-50 years, while gable roofs typically last 25-40 years. Quality installation and materials matter more than roof style for longevity.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I convert my gable roof to a hip roof?',
    answer: 'Yes, but it\'s a major structural renovation requiring engineering review, permits, and significant investment ($15,000-$50,000+). The conversion involves removing the gable ends, adding new rafters, and completely rebuilding the roof structure. Most homeowners only consider this during major renovations or when required by new hurricane codes. Consult a structural engineer first.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Which roof is better for hurricanes?',
    answer: 'Hip roofs significantly outperform gable roofs in hurricane conditions. Their aerodynamic four-sided design has no exposed gable ends vulnerable to wind uplift. Studies show hip roofs are 2-3 times more resistant to hurricane damage. Many coastal building codes now require hip roofs in high-velocity hurricane zones. If you live in coastal areas, hip roofs are the recommended choice.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do hip roofs have less attic space?',
    answer: 'Yes, hip roofs typically have 15-30% less usable attic space than gable roofs because all four sides slope inward, reducing vertical wall space. This matters if you need attic storage or plan to convert attic space to living area. Gable roofs provide maximum attic volume with full-height walls at both ends. Consider your storage needs when choosing roof styles.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Which roof style is better for solar panels?',
    answer: 'Gable roofs are generally better for solar panels because they offer larger, uninterrupted slope areas oriented toward the sun. Hip roofs have more angles and transitions, potentially reducing optimal panel placement. However, hip roofs can still accommodate solar arrays effectively—placement just requires more planning. South-facing slopes on either roof type work well for solar installations.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does each roof style cost?',
    answer: 'On a 2,000 sq ft home, expect: Gable roof $8,000-$15,000 (average $11,500), Hip roof $10,000-$18,000 (average $14,000). The 15-20% premium for hip roofs comes from additional materials and labor. Costs vary by region, materials, and complexity. Get multiple quotes from licensed contractors. The higher initial investment in a hip roof often pays off in durability and lower insurance premiums in hurricane zones.'

          Understanding Roof Styles: The Foundation of Your Decision
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-weather-dark mb-4">
          Your roof style is a fundamental architectural decision that impacts your home's structural integrity, weather resistance, energy efficiency, and curb appeal. Hip and gable roofs are the two most common residential roof styles in America, each with distinct advantages and trade-offs.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-weather-dark mb-4">
          This guide provides an objective comparison to help homeowners, builders, and architects make informed decisions. We'll examine cost differences, climate suitability, maintenance requirements, and architectural considerations based on 15+ years of roofing experience in coastal South Carolina.

            A hip roof has slopes on all four sides that meet at a ridge at the top. All sides slope downward to the walls, with no vertical gable ends. The result is a pyramid-like shape (on square buildings) or elongated pyramid (on rectangular buildings).

            <p className="text-weather-dark">
              Hip roofs are strongly recommended in hurricane-prone areas. Their aerodynamic design significantly reduces wind damage risk. Many coastal building codes now require hip roofs or extensive gable end reinforcement. Insurance companies may offer 10-30% discounts for hip roofs in high-wind zones.

            </p>
            <p className="text-weather-dark">
              Both styles handle snow well with proper pitch (6/12 or steeper). Hip roofs shed snow slightly more efficiently due to four slopes, but gable roofs perform adequately. Proper insulation and ventilation matter more than roof style in snow climates. Consider local architectural style preferences.

              In areas without extreme weather, choose based on budget, architectural style, and personal preference. Gable roofs offer cost savings and more attic space. Hip roofs provide superior durability and sophisticated appearance. Both perform well in moderate conditions.

              Hip roofs offer better tornado resistance due to aerodynamic design and self-bracing structure. Combine with hurricane straps, proper bracing, and impact-resistant shingles. While no roof is tornado-proof, hip roofs perform better in high-wind events common to tornado-prone regions.

            <p className="text-weather-dark">
              In hurricane zones, insurance premium reductions of 10-30% can offset higher hip roof costs over 5-10 years. Get quotes with both roof types to compare actual savings in your area.

            <p className="text-weather-dark">
              Hip roofs lasting 5-10 years longer means fewer replacements over the home's lifetime. On a 30-year horizon, this can save $5,000-$10,000 in replacement costs.

            <h4 className="font-bold text-weather-black mb-2">Resale Value Impact</h4>
            <p className="text-weather-dark">
              In high-wind areas, hip roofs can add 2-5% to home value due to superior protection and lower insurance costs. In moderate climates, roof style has minimal impact on resale value—condition matters more than design.
