            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">The elevated forecast is driven by <strong>above-average ocean temperatures</strong> and favorable atmospheric conditions. Historically, October and early November produce some of the most intense storms, as water temperatures remain warm while upper-level wind patterns become more conducive to storm development.</p>

          question: 'When does the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season end?',
          answer: 'The official Atlantic hurricane season ends on November 30, 2025. However, storms can form outside this window. October and November are historically peak months for intense hurricanes, so preparation should not be delayed.'
        },
        {
          question: 'How much does a hurricane preparedness roof inspection cost?',
          answer: 'Weather Shield Roofing provides FREE comprehensive hurricane preparedness inspections with no obligation. Our certified specialists will identify vulnerabilities, document your roof\'s condition for insurance purposes, and provide a detailed action plan‚Äîcompletely free.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Can I inspect my own roof for hurricane readiness?',
          answer: 'While you can check for obvious issues like missing shingles from the ground, a professional inspection is critical. Roofing experts have training and tools to identify subtle problems like compromised flashing, soft spots in the deck, and inadequate ventilation that are invisible from ground level but catastrophic during hurricanes.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What are hurricane straps and do I need them?',
          answer: 'Hurricane straps (also called roof clips) are metal connectors that anchor your roof structure to your home\'s walls, preventing uplift during extreme winds. Modern building codes require them, but older homes often lack proper reinforcement. If your Myrtle Beach home was built before 2000, you likely need hurricane straps installed.'
        },
        {
          question: 'How far from my roof should I trim tree branches?',
          answer: 'Trim ALL branches within 10 feet of your roof. Hurricane-force winds can whip branches 20+ feet from their resting position, turning them into battering rams that punch holes in roofs. Dead or diseased trees near your home should be removed entirely by certified arborists.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Will my homeowners insurance cover hurricane roof damage?',
          answer: 'Coverage varies significantly by policy. Many standard homeowners insurance policies include wind damage, but some require separate hurricane/windstorm policies. Contact your insurance agent NOW to verify your coverage, understand your deductible (often percentage-based for hurricanes), and confirm whether you have replacement cost or actual cash value coverage. Weather Shield Roofing works directly with insurance companies and handles claims for you.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What should I do if my roof is damaged during a hurricane?',
          answer: 'Safety first‚Äînever go on your roof during a storm or immediately after when conditions are dangerous. Once it\'s safe, document damage with photos and videos. If possible, place tarps over compromised areas to prevent further water damage. Then call Weather Shield Roofing at (843) 877-5539 for 24/7 emergency service. We prioritize storm damage calls and work with your insurance company.'
        },
        {
          question: 'How long does it take to schedule a roof inspection?',
          answer: 'Weather Shield Roofing typically schedules inspections within 24-48 hours during non-emergency periods. However, once a hurricane warning is issued, we become fully booked for weeks. Schedule your FREE inspection NOW while we have availability‚Äîdon\'t wait until a storm is approaching.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Are impact-resistant shingles worth the cost for hurricane protection?',
          answer: 'Absolutely. Impact-resistant shingles rated for 110+ mph winds dramatically outperform standard shingles during hurricanes. They resist tearing, have enhanced adhesive to prevent wind uplift, and may qualify you for insurance discounts. For Myrtle Beach homes in high-risk hurricane zones, impact-resistant shingles are an excellent investment that pays for itself through avoided damage and lower insurance premiums.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Can I still prepare my roof if a hurricane is already approaching?',
          answer: 'Once a hurricane warning is issued (typically 36-48 hours before landfall), it\'s generally too late for professional preparation. Contractors are overwhelmed, materials are scarce, and evacuations may be ordered. This is why we emphasize acting NOW in October while hurricane season is still active but storms aren\'t imminent. Your window to prepare properly is right now.'

                  <p class="text-gray-800">Days of rain before Helene arrived saturated the ground. When 60+ mph winds hit, massive oaks and pines toppled like dominoes ‚Äì directly onto roofs. <strong>Tree damage accounted for 73% of all roof claims</strong> in the Charleston area.</p>

                  <p class="text-gray-800">Unlike typical hurricanes that pass quickly, Helene's slow movement meant <strong>12+ hours of sustained winds</strong>. Shingles that might have survived a 3-hour storm failed after half a day of battering.</p>

                  <p class="text-gray-800">With 1 million+ South Carolinians without power and roofing contractors overwhelmed, many families waited <strong>2-3 weeks for emergency tarping</strong>. Secondary water damage turned minor roof issues into full replacements.</p>

            <p class="text-lg mb-6">The Martinez family in Mount Pleasant learned this the hard way. A 60-year-old oak fell on their home during Helene, punching through their 8-year-old roof. Because they had documented pre-storm roof inspections, their insurance claim was approved within 72 hours. Their neighbors without documentation? Still fighting their claims one year later.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-800 font-semibold">Bottom line: File your claim the day damage occurs, even if you're not sure how bad it is. You can always withdraw it later.</p>

          question: 'How soon after a storm should I have my roof inspected?',
          answer: 'Within 24-48 hours if possible. Early detection prevents secondary damage and strengthens insurance claims. During Hurricane Helene, homeowners who called within 72 hours had 94% claim approval rates versus 67% for those who waited 2+ weeks. We offer 24/7 emergency inspections: (843) 877-5539.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Will filing an insurance claim for storm damage increase my rates in South Carolina?',
          answer: 'No. South Carolina law (Code 38-75-790) prohibits insurance companies from raising your premiums due to claims for wind, hail, or hurricane damage. This protection means you should ALWAYS file legitimate storm damage claims without fear of rate increases.'
        },
        {
          question: 'How long do emergency roof tarps last in Charleston\'s climate?',
          answer: 'Emergency tarps are designed for SHORT-TERM protection only (30-90 days maximum). Charleston\'s intense UV exposure, high humidity, and coastal winds degrade tarps rapidly. After Hurricane Helene, tarps left on for 6+ months universally failed, causing additional water damage. If you\'re still under a tarp from storm damage, call us immediately for permanent repair options.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What\'s the #1 lesson from Hurricane Helene for Charleston homeowners?',
          answer: 'TREE MANAGEMENT. 73% of Helene roof damage in the Charleston area came from falling trees and branches, not wind alone. Keep all branches trimmed at least 10 feet from your roofline, and have any trees within 50 feet evaluated by a certified arborist. This single action prevents the majority of hurricane roof damage.'
        },
        {
          question: 'How do I know if my roof damage is from Hurricane Helene or normal wear?',
          answer: 'This is THE critical question for insurance claims. Professional storm damage inspection looks for: concentrated damage patterns, matching damage on neighbor roofs, correlation with NWS wind/hail reports, and specific impact signatures. We provide FREE storm damage assessments with documentation your insurance company accepts. Without professional verification, insurers often deny claims as "pre-existing."'
        },
        {
          question: 'What should I do if my insurance company denies or underpays my Helene claim?',
          answer: 'DON\'T ACCEPT IT. South Carolina law requires insurers to act in "good faith." After Helene, we successfully appealed 87% of initial claim denials/underpayments. We provide: engineering reports, independent adjuster reviews, and damage documentation that insurance companies must consider. Our advocacy service is free ‚Äì we only get paid when your claim is approved.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Can I make temporary repairs before my insurance adjuster visits?',
          answer: 'YES ‚Äì you MUST prevent further damage (this is in your policy). Emergency tarping, boarding up holes, and stopping active leaks is required. HOWEVER: Document everything with photos BEFORE repairs, save ALL receipts, and don\'t make permanent repairs until after adjuster inspection. Emergency repairs are reimbursable under your policy.'
        },
        {
          question: 'How much does storm damage roof repair cost in Charleston?',
          answer: 'Costs vary based on damage extent: Emergency tarping ($500-1,500), Partial repairs ($2,000-8,000), Full roof replacement ($8,000-25,000+). Most Hurricane Helene damage was covered by insurance. We provide free estimates and work directly with your insurance company to ensure you receive full coverage entitled under your policy. No out-of-pocket costs until insurance approval.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What makes a roof "hurricane-resistant" for future Charleston storms?',
          answer: 'Key upgrades: Impact-resistant Class 4 shingles (withstand 2-inch hail at 90+ mph), reinforced roof deck attachment, sealed roof deck with peel-and-stick underlayment, properly rated flashings, and engineered soffit/fascia systems. These upgrades can reduce insurance premiums by 10-30% and qualify for fortified home designation. We specialize in hurricane-resistant installations for Charleston\'s climate.'
