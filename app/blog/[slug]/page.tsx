            <p class="text-lg mb-6">When Helene made landfall, it wasn't classified as the "big one" meteorologists feared. Yet it devastated our community in ways no one predicted. Here's what made Helene so destructive to Charleston roofs:</p>

            <div class="bg-weather-danger/10 border-l-4 border-weather-danger p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
              <h4 class="font-bold text-weather-dark mb-4 text-xl">Helene's Destructive Trinity</h4>

                <div>
                  <p class="font-semibold text-weather-dark mb-2">1. Saturated Soil + High Winds = Falling Trees</p>
                  <p class="text-gray-800">Days of rain before Helene arrived saturated the ground. When 60+ mph winds hit, massive oaks and pines toppled like dominoes – directly onto roofs. <strong>Tree damage accounted for 73% of all roof claims</strong> in the Charleston area.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <p class="font-semibold text-weather-dark mb-2">2. Prolonged Wind Exposure</p>
                  <p class="text-gray-800">Unlike typical hurricanes that pass quickly, Helene's slow movement meant <strong>12+ hours of sustained winds</strong>. Shingles that might have survived a 3-hour storm failed after half a day of battering.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                  <p class="font-semibold text-weather-dark mb-2">3. The "Two Weeks Under Tarps" Crisis</p>
                  <p class="text-gray-800">With 1 million+ South Carolinians without power and roofing contractors overwhelmed, many families waited <strong>2-3 weeks for emergency tarping</strong>. Secondary water damage turned minor roof issues into full replacements.</p>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>

            <p class="text-lg mb-6">The Martinez family in Mount Pleasant learned this the hard way. A 60-year-old oak fell on their home during Helene, punching through their 8-year-old roof. Because they had documented pre-storm roof inspections, their insurance claim was approved within 72 hours. Their neighbors without documentation? Still fighting their claims one year later.</p>

            <p class="text-lg mb-6">Drive through any Charleston neighborhood today, and you'll see them – bright blue tarps covering damaged roofs. According to FEMA, <strong>over 15,000 South Carolina homes</strong> are still using temporary tarp repairs from Helene damage.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-800 mb-3">Insurance adjusters look for evidence the damage was <em>pre-existing</em> rather than storm-caused. The longer you wait, the harder it is to prove causation. Plus, secondary damage from delayed repairs (mold, water damage, structural issues) is often denied as "maintenance neglect."</p>
                <p class="text-gray-800 font-semibold">Bottom line: File your claim the day damage occurs, even if you're not sure how bad it is. You can always withdraw it later.</p>

        {
          question: 'How soon after a storm should I have my roof inspected?',
          answer: 'Within 24-48 hours if possible. Early detection prevents secondary damage and strengthens insurance claims. During Hurricane Helene, homeowners who called within 72 hours had 94% claim approval rates versus 67% for those who waited 2+ weeks. We offer 24/7 emergency inspections: (843) 877-5539.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Will filing an insurance claim for storm damage increase my rates in South Carolina?',
          answer: 'No. South Carolina law (Code 38-75-790) prohibits insurance companies from raising your premiums due to claims for wind, hail, or hurricane damage. This protection means you should ALWAYS file legitimate storm damage claims without fear of rate increases.'
        },
        {
          question: 'How long do emergency roof tarps last in Charleston\'s climate?',
          answer: 'Emergency tarps are designed for SHORT-TERM protection only (30-90 days maximum). Charleston\'s intense UV exposure, high humidity, and coastal winds degrade tarps rapidly. After Hurricane Helene, tarps left on for 6+ months universally failed, causing additional water damage. If you\'re still under a tarp from storm damage, call us immediately for permanent repair options.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What\'s the #1 lesson from Hurricane Helene for Charleston homeowners?',
          answer: 'TREE MANAGEMENT. 73% of Helene roof damage in the Charleston area came from falling trees and branches, not wind alone. Keep all branches trimmed at least 10 feet from your roofline, and have any trees within 50 feet evaluated by a certified arborist. This single action prevents the majority of hurricane roof damage.'
        },
        {
          question: 'How do I know if my roof damage is from Hurricane Helene or normal wear?',
          answer: 'This is THE critical question for insurance claims. Professional storm damage inspection looks for: concentrated damage patterns, matching damage on neighbor roofs, correlation with NWS wind/hail reports, and specific impact signatures. We provide FREE storm damage assessments with documentation your insurance company accepts. Without professional verification, insurers often deny claims as "pre-existing."'
        },
        {
          question: 'What should I do if my insurance company denies or underpays my Helene claim?',
          answer: 'DON\'T ACCEPT IT. South Carolina law requires insurers to act in "good faith." After Helene, we successfully appealed 87% of initial claim denials/underpayments. We provide: engineering reports, independent adjuster reviews, and damage documentation that insurance companies must consider. Our advocacy service is free – we only get paid when your claim is approved.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Can I make temporary repairs before my insurance adjuster visits?',
          answer: 'YES – you MUST prevent further damage (this is in your policy). Emergency tarping, boarding up holes, and stopping active leaks is required. HOWEVER: Document everything with photos BEFORE repairs, save ALL receipts, and don\'t make permanent repairs until after adjuster inspection. Emergency repairs are reimbursable under your policy.'
        },
        {
          question: 'How much does storm damage roof repair cost in Charleston?',
          answer: 'Costs vary based on damage extent: Emergency tarping ($500-1,500), Partial repairs ($2,000-8,000), Full roof replacement ($8,000-25,000+). Most Hurricane Helene damage was covered by insurance. We provide free estimates and work directly with your insurance company to ensure you receive full coverage entitled under your policy. No out-of-pocket costs until insurance approval.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What makes a roof "hurricane-resistant" for future Charleston storms?',
          answer: 'Key upgrades: Impact-resistant Class 4 shingles (withstand 2-inch hail at 90+ mph), reinforced roof deck attachment, sealed roof deck with peel-and-stick underlayment, properly rated flashings, and engineered soffit/fascia systems. These upgrades can reduce insurance premiums by 10-30% and qualify for fortified home designation. We specialize in hurricane-resistant installations for Charleston\'s climate.'

        {
          question: 'How often should I have my roof professionally inspected?',
          answer: 'In Myrtle Beach\'s coastal environment, we recommend twice yearly – once before hurricane season (May) and once after (November). Interior inspections should happen quarterly. Most insurance companies require annual documentation.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What voids my roof warranty?',
          answer: 'Common warranty killers include: walking on the roof yourself, using non-certified contractors, skipping required maintenance, improper ventilation, and satellite dish installation without professional help. Always check your specific warranty terms.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Can regular maintenance really add 10+ years to my roof?',
          answer: 'Absolutely. The National Roofing Contractors Association confirms that proper maintenance can double a roof\'s lifespan. We\'ve seen well-maintained roofs last 30+ years when the average neglected roof fails at 12-15 years.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What\'s included in a professional roof maintenance service?',
          answer: 'Our comprehensive service includes: complete visual inspection, gutter cleaning, debris removal, minor repairs (loose shingles, small sealing), flashing check, ventilation assessment, detailed report with photos, and warranty documentation.'
        },
        {
          question: 'How much does emergency roof repair typically cost?',
          answer: 'Emergency repairs cost 2-3 times more than planned maintenance. While specific prices vary, emergency repairs often cost $3,000-$7,000 due to urgency, overtime labor, and secondary damage. Prevention through maintenance saves thousands.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Will my insurance cover roof damage?',
          answer: 'Most policies cover sudden damage (storms, fallen trees) but NOT gradual deterioration from lack of maintenance. Insurance companies can request maintenance records. Without them, even storm damage claims may be denied. Our maintenance documentation protects your coverage.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What are the most common roofing problems in Myrtle Beach?',
          answer: 'Our coastal climate creates unique challenges: salt air corrosion, high humidity causing mold/algae growth, hurricane wind damage, intense UV degradation, and rapid temperature changes. Regular maintenance addresses all these issues.'
        },
        {
          question: 'How do I know if my roof has storm damage?',
          answer: 'Look for missing or torn shingles, dents from hail, exposed nail heads, granule loss, damaged flashing, and interior water stains. However, some damage isn\'t visible from the ground. Professional inspection after storms is crucial.'
        }
