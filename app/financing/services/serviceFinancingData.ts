        answer: 'Yes! We approve metal roofing financing for all credit types including poor credit, fair credit, and even applicants previously denied elsewhere.

        answer: 'Metal roof financing terms range from 12 to 60 months depending on your needs and qualification. Longer terms (48-60 months) provide lower monthly payments which many homeowners prefer given metal roofing\'s higher initial investment.

ENERGY STAR certified metal roofs reflect 70% of solar energy, keeping your home cooler. When you finance through us, you get immediate access to these energy savings while spreading the installation investment over manageable monthly payments.'

This includes tear-off of existing materials, any wood deck repairs discovered during installation, and all materials and labor for the complete installation.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Is there a prepayment penalty if I pay off my metal roof loan early?',
        answer: 'No! All our metal roofing financing programs allow early payoff without any prepayment penalties. If you receive an insurance settlement, tax refund, or simply want to pay off the balance early, you can do so at any time and save on interest charges. Many customers with promotional 0% APR financing pay off their balance before the promotional period ends to avoid interest charges.'
