      title="Curling & Buckling Shingles"
      description="Curling or buckling shingles are a clear warning sign that your roof is nearing the end of its lifespan or suffering from ventilation problems. When shingles curl upward at the edges or buckle in the center, they lose their ability to shed water properly, making your roof vulnerable to leaks and wind damage. In Myrtle Beach's hot, humid climate, shingle curling accelerates due to heat and moisture exposure. Weather Shield Roofing can diagnose the root cause and provide solutions ranging from targeted repairs to full replacement."

      faqs={[
        {
          question: "Can curling shingles be repaired, or do they need replacement?",
          answer: "Minor curling on a few shingles can sometimes be addressed with adhesive or sealant, but this is a temporary fix. Widespread curling indicates systemic issues (age, ventilation problems) that require replacement. Attempting to flatten curled shingles often causes them to crack and break."
        },
        {
          question: "How long does it take for shingles to start curling?",
          answer: "On properly ventilated roofs with quality materials, shingles shouldn't curl for 15-25 years. However, poor ventilation can cause curling in as little as 5-10 years. If your roof is curling prematurely, ventilation problems are likely the cause."
        },
        {
          question: "Will curling shingles cause leaks?",
          answer: "Yes, eventually. Curled shingles create gaps that allow wind-driven rain to penetrate. They're also more likely to be torn off during storms, exposing the roof deck to water damage. Addressing curling early prevents costly leak repairs later."
        },
        {
          question: "Does homeowners insurance cover curling shingles?",
          answer: "Typically no, unless the curling resulted from a covered event like a storm. Normal wear and tear, age, and poor ventilation are considered maintenance issues not covered by insurance. However, if curling led to leaks that caused interior damage, that portion might be covered."
        },
        {
          question: "What's the difference between curling and buckling?",
          answer: "Curling (cupping or clawing) affects individual shingles at the edges or corners. Buckling creates wave-like distortions across multiple shingles, often in vertical lines, and typically indicates deck movement or improper installation. Both compromise roof integrity."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I prevent shingle curling with better ventilation?",
          answer: "Yes! Proper attic ventilation is the #1 preventive measure. It keeps attic temperatures close to outdoor temps, preventing heat damage to shingles. If your roof is already curling due to poor ventilation, improving ventilation won't reverse the damage but will protect a new roof."
