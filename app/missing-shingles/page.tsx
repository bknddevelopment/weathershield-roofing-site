      faqs={[
        {
          question: "How many missing shingles does it take to cause a leak?",
          answer: "Even a single missing shingle can allow water infiltration, especially during heavy rain or wind-driven rain. The roof's underlayment provides temporary protection, but it's not designed to be a permanent barrier. Multiple missing shingles significantly increase leak risk and should be addressed immediately."
        },
        {
          question: "Can you replace just a few shingles, or do I need a whole new roof?",
          answer: "In most cases, if damage is localized and your roof is relatively young (under 15 years), we can replace individual shingles or small sections. However, if your roof is older and showing widespread damage, a full replacement may be more cost-effective long-term."
        },
        {
          question: "Will new shingles match my existing roof?",
          answer: "We work hard to match the color, style, and manufacturer of your existing shingles. However, slight color variations may occur due to weathering and UV exposure on older roofs. In most cases, the difference becomes less noticeable over time as new shingles weather."
        },
        {
          question: "How long do shingle repairs last?",
          answer: "When professionally installed, replacement shingles should last as long as the remaining shingles on your roof. We use the same high-quality materials and installation techniques as full roof replacements, ensuring durability and weather resistance."
        },
        {
          question: "Is shingle replacement covered by homeowners insurance?",
          answer: "If shingle damage resulted from a covered event like a storm, hurricane, or falling tree, most insurance policies will cover repairs. Gradual wear and tear due to age typically isn't covered. We can provide detailed documentation and photos to support your claim."
        },
        {
          question: "What happens if I ignore missing shingles?",
          answer: "Ignoring missing shingles exposes your roof deck to moisture, which can lead to wood rot, mold growth, structural damage, and expensive interior repairs. What starts as a simple shingle replacement can escalate into thousands of dollars in additional damage if left unaddressed."
