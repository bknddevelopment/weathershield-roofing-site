Offers the most authentic Mediterranean aesthetic with warm, earthy tones that deepen with age. Clay is naturally porous, allowing moisture to evaporate, and develops a beautiful patina over time. Available in S-tile (Spanish Mission barrel shape), flat profile, and interlocking designs. Clay is the premium choice for historic homes and luxury properties, with lifespans exceeding 100 years."

        {
          question: "Is my house strong enough to support a tile roof?",
          answer: "It depends on your home's construction. Tile roofs weigh 900-1,200 lbs per square (100 sq ft)—roughly 10x heavier than asphalt. Most homes built before the 1980s and those not designed for tile require structural reinforcement. A licensed structural engineer can assess your roof framing and design necessary upgrades (additional rafters, reinforced trusses, thicker decking). While reinforcement adds cost, it ensures safety and allows you to enjoy tile's 50-100 year lifespan. New construction designed for tile from the start avoids these costs."
        },
        {
          question: "How long do clay tile roofs really last?",
          answer: "Clay tile roofs commonly last 75-100 years, and some historic examples exceed 200 years. Unlike asphalt shingles that deteriorate from UV exposure and weathering, clay tile is kiln-fired ceramic that doesn't decay. The tiles themselves often outlive the building. However, underlayment typically lasts 30-50 years and requires replacement (tiles are removed, underlayment replaced, tiles reinstalled). Concrete tile generally lasts 50-75 years. Proper installation and maintenance are critical to achieving maximum lifespan."
        },
        {
          question: "Can tile roofs withstand hurricanes in Myrtle Beach?",
          answer: "Yes, when properly installed with modern hurricane-rated systems. Tile roofing has earned unfair reputation for hurricane vulnerability due to old installation methods (nails, no adhesive). Modern tile roofs use mechanical fasteners (screws), foam adhesives, and individual tile securing systems rated for 150+ mph winds. Tile's weight actually helps resist uplift forces. Properly installed tile roofs have proven exceptional hurricane performance in Florida and coastal areas. Always use certified tile installers following current building codes."
        },
        {
          question: "What's the difference between clay and concrete tile?",
          answer: "Clay tile is made from natural terra cotta clay and kiln-fired, offering authentic aesthetics, superior longevity (75-100+ years), and natural breathability. It's lighter in density but more fragile. Concrete tile is molded and cured, offering similar profiles at lower cost and slightly less weight. Concrete lasts 50-75 years and comes in more color options. Clay develops a beautiful patina; concrete can fade and may require recoating. Clay is preferred for luxury and historic homes; concrete offers excellent value for new construction."
        },
        {
          question: "Are tile roofs energy-efficient in hot climates like Myrtle Beach?",
          answer: "Extremely efficient. Tile roofing reduces cooling costs by 20-30% through three mechanisms: 1) Thermal mass—tile absorbs and slowly releases heat, preventing rapid temperature swings, 2) Ventilation—barrel tiles create air channels that exhaust hot air, reducing attic temperatures, 3) Reflectivity—light-colored tiles reflect solar radiation. Studies show tile roofs keep attics 10-20°F cooler than asphalt. The energy savings over a 50-year lifespan can offset a significant portion of the higher upfront cost."
        },
        {
          question: "What happens if tiles crack or break? Are repairs expensive?",
          answer: "Individual tiles can be replaced relatively easily by professionals. The process involves carefully lifting surrounding tiles, removing the broken tile, and sliding in a new one. Replacement tiles cost $2-$10 each depending on material and style. The labor is more expensive than the tile itself. It's critical to repair broken tiles promptly—even one cracked tile can allow water infiltration that damages underlayment and decking. Keep spare tiles from your original installation for perfect color matching."

      climateNote="Myrtle Beach's hot, humid coastal climate is ideal for tile roofing. Tile's thermal mass, natural ventilation, and reflectivity keep homes cooler in summer heat. Clay tile's breathability prevents moisture trapping common in humid environments. However, structural considerations are critical—most coastal homes need reinforcement for tile's weight. Hurricane-rated installation is mandatory. Salt air doesn't affect clay or concrete tile, making it an excellent long-term coastal investment."
