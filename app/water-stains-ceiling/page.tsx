      title="Water Stains & Ceiling Damage"
      description="Water stains on ceilings or walls are visible evidence of an active or past roof leak. These brown or yellowish discolorations indicate that water has penetrated your roof, traveled through insulation and framing, and saturated drywall. Beyond the cosmetic issue, water stains signal ongoing moisture problems that can lead to mold growth, structural rot, and compromised indoor air quality. Weather Shield Roofing specializes in tracing water stains back to their source, repairing roof leaks, and addressing interior damage to fully restore your home."

      faqs={[
        {
          question: "Can I just paint over water stains, or do I need to fix the leak first?",
          answer: "You must fix the leak first. Painting over active water stains without addressing the source will result in the stain bleeding through new paint and continued water damage. Once the leak is repaired and the area is dry, stains can be sealed with stain-blocking primer and repainted."
        },
        {
          question: "How do I know if the water stain is from the roof or plumbing?",
          answer: "Roof leaks typically appear after rain or in rooms below attic spaces. Plumbing leaks may occur anytime and are often near bathrooms or kitchens. Professional inspection is the only way to definitively identify the source, as water can travel far from entry points before staining ceilings."
        },
        {
          question: "Are water stains dangerous, or just cosmetic?",
          answer: "Water stains are evidence of moisture problems that can be very dangerous. Prolonged moisture leads to mold growth (health hazard), wood rot (structural risk), compromised insulation (energy waste), and electrical hazards if water reaches wiring. They should never be ignored."
        },
        {
          question: "How long does it take for a roof leak to cause ceiling stains?",
          answer: "It varies. A severe leak can cause visible stains within hours or days. Slower leaks may take weeks or months to saturate insulation and drywall enough to create stains. By the time stains appear, significant hidden damage often already exists in the attic."
        },
        {
          question: "Will insurance cover water stain repair and repainting?",
          answer: "If the leak resulted from a covered event (storm, falling tree, sudden damage), most policies cover both the roof repair and resulting interior damage including drywall, repainting, and mold remediation. Gradual leaks from poor maintenance may not be covered. We provide documentation to support insurance claims."
        },
        {
          question: "Can water stains cause mold?",
          answer: "Yes. Mold can begin growing within 24-48 hours of water exposure. Water stains indicate prolonged moisture presence—perfect conditions for mold. If you see stains, smell musty odors, or have health symptoms (respiratory issues, allergies), professional mold inspection and remediation may be necessary."
