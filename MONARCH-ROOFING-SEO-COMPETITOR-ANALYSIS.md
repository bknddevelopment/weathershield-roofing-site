## 8. Content Gaps & Opportunities

### Where We Can Outrank Monarch

#### 1. **Emergency Services** (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Gap:** Monarch has NO dedicated emergency landing page

- No emergency-specific service page
- Storm damage page is generic, not urgent

**Our Advantage:**
- ✅ /emergency/ page
- ✅ /emergency-optimized/ (performance variant)
- ✅ Emergency CTAs throughout site

**Action Plan:**
1. Create 10+ emergency content pieces:
   - "What to Do During a Roof Emergency in Charleston"
   - "Emergency Roof Tarping: Fast Protection in 2 Hours"
   - "24/7 Emergency Response Team: Here When You Need Us"
2. Target keywords:
   - "24/7 roofer charleston"
   - "emergency roof repair near me"

3. Add emergency schema markup
4. Create video: "Our Emergency Response Process"

#### 2. **Hyperlocal Neighborhood Pages**

**Gap:** Monarch has generic location coverage for Charleston area
- Single Charleston page (/roofing/charleston-sc/)

- Links go back to Myrtle Beach office

**Our Advantage:**

   - Local customer testimonials (if available)
   - Google Map embed for that area

#### 3. **Cost/Pricing Transparency**

   - "Free Roof Inspection for Insurance Claims"
2. Partner visibility:
   - "We work with: State Farm, Allstate, USAA, Farmers..."
   - Add partner logos

### Top 3 Priorities (Start Immediately)

**1. Emergency Services Domination**
- Create comprehensive emergency content
- Optimize for emergency keywords
- Launch targeted PPC campaign
- Position as "Charleston's 24/7 Emergency Roofing Experts"
- **Why:** Monarch has zero focus here, easy wins

**2. Hyperlocal Expansion**
- Build from 20 to 50 Charleston neighborhood pages
- Each with unique, localized content

- **Why:** Monarch only has 1 generic Charleston page

**3. Trust Signal Amplification**
- Get 100+ Google reviews
- Add certifications (GAF, BBB)
- Publish pricing transparency
- Add video testimonials
- **Why:** Establish credibility to compete with Monarch's 1,600 reviews

### What NOT to Do

❌ **Don't compete head-to-head on their strengths**
   - Don't try to outrank "roofing company charleston" immediately
   - Don't try to match their 15+ years of history
   - Don't spread budget thin across all keywords

❌ **Don't copy their exact strategy**
   - Their multi-location model doesn't fit our business
   - Their generic Charleston approach is their weakness
   - Their lack of emergency focus is our opportunity

❌ **Don't neglect user experience for SEO**
   - Keep page speed advantage
   - Don't stuff keywords unnaturally
   - Maintain modern, clean design

### Success Formula

```
Emergency Focus + Hyperlocal Authority + Trust Signals + Page Speed =
Charleston Market Leadership in 6 Months
```

**Expected Outcome by Month 6:**
- Rank #1-3 for 5+ emergency keywords
- Rank top 10 for 20+ primary keywords
