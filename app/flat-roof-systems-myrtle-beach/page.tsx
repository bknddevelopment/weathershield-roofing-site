      title="Flat Roof Systems: Modern Low-Slope Solutions"
      description="Flat and low-slope roof systems serve commercial buildings, modern architectural homes, and roof extensions like porches, garages, and additions. Unlike traditional pitched residential roofs, flat roofs use specialized membrane systems designed for water pooling, thermal expansion, and continuous UV exposure. TPO (thermoplastic polyolefin), EPDM (rubber), and modified bitumen are the three primary flat roofing systems, each offering distinct advantages for durability, energy efficiency, and installation methods. Weather Shield Roofing specializes in commercial-grade flat roof installations with proven performance in coastal environments."

          description: "White single-ply reflective membrane that's heat-welded at seams for superior waterproofing. TPO is the most popular commercial roofing material due to its energy efficiency (reflects up to 80% of UV radiation), durability, and affordability. Heat-welded seams are stronger than glued or mechanically fastened seams. Available in white, tan, and gray. TPO typically lasts 20-30 years with minimal maintenance. Excellent for hot climates like Myrtle Beach."

          description: "Black synthetic rubber membrane available in large sheets to minimize seams. EPDM is extremely durable, resistant to ozone and UV, and proven over 50+ years of use. While black color absorbs heat (less energy-efficient than TPO), EPDM is flexible in extreme temperatures and resists cracking. Seams are glued or taped. EPDM is the most affordable flat roofing option and lasts 20-25 years. Popular for residential flat roofs and budget commercial projects."

          title: "Modified Bitumen (Mod Bit)",
          description: "Asphalt-based multi-ply system with polymer modifiers for flexibility. Installed by torch-down (flame application) or self-adhered sheets. Modified bitumen offers excellent waterproofing and is more puncture-resistant than single-ply membranes. The granulated cap sheet provides UV protection and slip resistance. Lifespan of 15-20 years. Popular for roof recovers and traditional commercial roofing. More labor-intensive than TPO/EPDM but highly reliable."

          title: "Fully Adhered vs. Mechanically Fastened",
          description: "Fully adhered systems use adhesive to bond membrane to substrate, creating wind-resistant, seamless installations. Ideal for high-wind coastal areas. Mechanically fastened systems use screws and plates at seams, allowing easier repairs but creating more potential leak points. Ballasted systems use gravel or pavers to hold membrane down—less common due to weight and maintenance challenges. Fully adhered is recommended for Myrtle Beach hurricane exposure."

          description: "Pre-designed insulation boards with built-in slopes (tapers) to direct water to drains, eliminating ponding water. Tapered systems are essential for truly flat roof decks. Insulation improves energy efficiency while solving drainage problems. Polyisocyanurate (polyiso) insulation provides high R-value in thin profiles. Cricket systems around rooftop equipment prevent water pooling."

          description: "Flat roof success depends on proper flashing around roof edges, penetrations (vents, pipes, HVAC), and transitions. Membrane is folded and sealed up walls and curbs. Metal termination bars secure edges. Pipe boots and vent flashings must be compatible with membrane material. Skylights and HVAC units require custom curb flashing. Professional workmanship at flashings prevents 90% of flat roof leaks."

          question: "How long does a flat roof last compared to a pitched roof?",
          answer: "Flat roof systems typically last 15-30 years depending on material (EPDM 20-25 years, TPO 20-30 years, modified bitumen 15-20 years). This is comparable to asphalt shingles (15-30 years) but shorter than metal (40-70 years) or tile (50-100 years). However, flat roofs are easier and less expensive to replace when the time comes. With proper maintenance—especially drainage management—flat roofs can reach the upper end of their lifespan expectations."
        },
        {
          question: "What's the difference between TPO and EPDM flat roofing?",
          answer: "TPO is a white thermoplastic membrane that's heat-welded at seams, creating incredibly strong, watertight bonds. It's highly reflective, reducing cooling costs significantly. EPDM is a black (or white) rubber membrane with glued or taped seams. EPDM is more affordable and extremely flexible, but black EPDM absorbs heat. TPO is more popular for commercial buildings due to energy efficiency. EPDM is preferred for residential flat roofs and budget projects. Both last 20-25 years with proper installation."
        },
        {
          question: "Do flat roofs leak more than pitched roofs?",
          answer: "Flat roofs don't inherently leak more—but they're less forgiving of installation errors and deferred maintenance. Pitched roofs shed water quickly by gravity; flat roofs rely on drainage systems. If drains clog or the roof ponds water, leaks can develop. The key to leak-free flat roofs: 1) Proper slope/tapered insulation, 2) Professional flashing installation, 3) Regular drain cleaning and debris removal, 4) Prompt repairs of punctures or seam issues. Well-maintained flat roofs perform as reliably as pitched roofs."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I add a flat roof to my existing home for an addition or garage?",
          answer: "Yes—flat roofing is ideal for additions, garages, porches, and modern extensions. TPO and EPDM systems work well for residential applications. The key is proper integration with existing roofing (flashing at wall transitions) and ensuring adequate drainage. Many modern homes incorporate flat or shed-style roofs for aesthetic reasons. Flat roofs also provide potential rooftop deck or solar panel opportunities. Professional design is essential to prevent water infiltration at connections."
        },
        {
          question: "How do I prevent ponding water on my flat roof?",
          answer: "Ponding water (standing water that doesn't drain within 48 hours) is the #1 enemy of flat roofs. Prevention strategies: 1) Install tapered insulation systems that create slopes directing water to drains, 2) Ensure minimum 1/4 inch per foot slope, 3) Use adequate number and size of drains for roof area, 4) Keep drains and scuppers clear of debris, 5) Install overflow scuppers as backup drainage, 6) Address any structural sagging immediately. Ponding water accelerates membrane deterioration and can lead to roof collapse in extreme cases."
        },
        {
          question: "Are flat roofs energy-efficient?",
          answer: "White TPO and PVC flat roofs are among the most energy-efficient roofing options available. They reflect 70-80% of solar radiation, dramatically reducing cooling costs—especially valuable for large commercial buildings with HVAC on the roof. Combined with proper insulation (R-30 or higher), flat roofs can achieve superior energy performance. Black EPDM absorbs heat but can be painted with reflective coatings. Many flat roof systems qualify for ENERGY STAR® certification and commercial energy tax credits."

      climateNote="Myrtle Beach's coastal environment requires careful flat roof material selection. High humidity, salt air, and intense UV exposure accelerate membrane aging. TPO white membranes offer excellent UV resistance and energy efficiency. Hurricane-force winds require fully adhered systems—avoid mechanically fastened roofs in high-wind zones. Proper drainage is critical in areas with heavy rainfall. Consider algae-resistant coatings for EPDM in humid climates."
