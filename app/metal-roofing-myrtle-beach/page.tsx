      description="Metal roofing represents the gold standard for longevity, hurricane resistance, and energy efficiency in coastal environments. With lifespans of 40-70 years (2-3 times longer than asphalt), metal roofs withstand extreme weather including hurricane-force winds up to 180 mph, heavy rainfall, and salt air corrosion. They reflect solar heat, reducing cooling costs by up to 25%, and require minimal maintenance. Available in standing seam panels, metal shingles, and corrugated styles, metal roofing offers modern aesthetics or traditional looks to complement any architectural style."

        {
          question: "Is metal roofing really worth the higher cost compared to asphalt shingles?",
          answer: "For most coastal homeowners, yes. While metal roofing costs 2-3x more upfront, it lasts 40-70 years (vs. 15-30 for asphalt), meaning you'll replace asphalt roofs 2-3 times during one metal roof's lifespan. Metal roofing also reduces cooling costs by 20-25%, requires virtually no maintenance, withstands hurricane-force winds better than any other roofing, and can qualify for insurance discounts. Over the roof's lifetime, metal often costs less than asphalt when factoring energy savings and avoided replacement costs."
        },
        {
          question: "Is metal roofing loud during rain and hailstorms?",
          answer: "Not when properly installed with quality underlayment and insulation. Modern metal roofs use synthetic underlayment and often include insulation layers that dramatically reduce noise. Stone-coated metal shingles are even quieter. Most homeowners report metal roofs are no louder than asphalt during rain. However, lightweight corrugated panels on uninsulated sheds or structures can be noisier. Professional installation with proper underlayment is key."
        },
        {
          question: "Can metal roofing withstand hurricane-force winds in Myrtle Beach?",
          answer: "Yes—metal roofing is the best hurricane-resistant roofing material available. Standing seam metal roofs with proper clip fastening systems are rated for winds up to 180 mph (exceeding Category 5 hurricanes). Unlike shingles that can lift and tear off, metal panels are mechanically fastened with concealed clips or screws, creating a continuous weather barrier. Metal roofs have repeatedly proven superior hurricane performance in coastal areas from Florida to North Carolina."
        },
        {
          question: "Does metal roofing rust in coastal saltwater environments?",
          answer: "Properly coated metal roofing resists rust extremely well. Galvalume® (aluminum-zinc coated steel) provides excellent corrosion resistance, especially with factory-applied PVDF paint finishes. Aluminum panels are naturally rust-proof. Copper and zinc also resist corrosion. Regular washing to remove salt buildup and proper installation to prevent water pooling ensure decades of rust-free performance. Avoid uncoated steel or cheap panels in coastal areas."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I install solar panels on a metal roof?",
          answer: "Yes—metal roofs are the ideal platform for solar panels. Standing seam systems allow clamp-mounted solar arrays without penetrating the roof (no leak risk). Metal's longevity (40-70 years) matches or exceeds solar panel lifespans, eliminating the need to remove panels for roof replacement. Metal's smooth surface simplifies panel mounting. If you're considering solar now or in the future, metal roofing is the best foundation."
        },
        {
          question: "What's the difference between standing seam and metal shingles?",
          answer: "Standing seam features long vertical panels (12-18 inches wide) running from ridge to eave with raised, interlocking seams and concealed fasteners. It offers superior weather protection, modern aesthetics, and the longest warranties. Metal shingles are individual or small panels resembling traditional shingles, slate, or tile. They're easier to install on complex roofs and offer classic aesthetics. Standing seam is more expensive but provides better performance; metal shingles are more affordable and versatile for traditional home styles."

Salt air, high winds, heavy rainfall, and intense UV exposure make metal's corrosion resistance, hurricane ratings, and reflective properties especially valuable. Choose Galvalume® or aluminum panels with PVDF finishes for maximum coastal durability. Metal roofs keep homes cooler in summer heat and withstand hurricane-force winds better than any other residential roofing material."
