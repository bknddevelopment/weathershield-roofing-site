# Image Directory Structure

Place your images in the appropriate subdirectories:

- **logo/** - Company logo files (PNG, SVG preferred)
- **hero/** - Hero section images for homepage and landing pages
- **services/** - Images for each service (kitchen, bathroom, cabinets)
- **gallery/** - Project portfolio images
- **team/** - Team member photos

## Image Guidelines

- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `modern-kitchen-white-cabinets.jpg`)
- Optimize images before uploading (recommended tools: TinyPNG, Squoosh)
- Preferred formats: WebP, AVIF with JPG/PNG fallbacks
- Keep file sizes under 500KB when possible
- Use high-resolution images (1920x1080 or higher) for hero sections
